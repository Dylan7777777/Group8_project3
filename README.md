# Group8_project3
## Members of our group
Our group was comprised of Akansha Singh, Irene Wang, Tapleen Lamba and Dylan D'Costa.

## Aim of our project
Our project was to have a stock visualization of 4 of largest capitalization.
We chose Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla.

These stocks were chosen for our visualization as we increasingly live in a world 
where we cannot do without their products or services. We chose Tesla over Amazon 
primarily because their products are becoming increasingly important in a carbon 
neutral world.

To create a visualization tool that is web based that gives users a quick 
overview of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla. There will be some 
fundamental data that gives an investor a synopsis of the financial health of 
the company and finally it’s stock price performance.
Our aim is to have two sets of visualizations with a drop down menu to choose 
the individual stock for the stock price performance.
1. Table of Fundamental Data
2. Stock Price Performance

## Execution of our project

Step 1 - Gathering of relevant Data: Using Pandas and Yfinance 
Step 2 - exporting the data to .csv
Step 3 – create SQLite database
Step 4 – create an app.py file to make API calls
Step 5 – export the data to a .json file
Step 6 – plot the data from these .json files

while our database was recognized by a database viewer we kept getting an attribute error in python as it wasn't recognized.

So we worked on a visualization without a json file using data for about a month to get some visualizations.
